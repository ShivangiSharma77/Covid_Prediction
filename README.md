# COVID19-Predictor
As in this time of Pandemic there has been an alarmingly high rate of COVID-19 patients due to which there arises a requirement of new mechanisms to predict the chances of being infected by scanning the X-ray of the user.
I have created a project using technologies like Machine Learning and DevOps approach. Iâ€™ve provided a web-interface where the user provides their X-ray images and the prediction of chances of getting COVID-19 are displayed.
